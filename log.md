# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 6/28/21 


**Today's Progress**: Started by doings some exercises with parallax scrolling and lazy loading, that I haven't gotten the chance to actually make make from scratch.

**Thoughts:** The lazy loading wasn't working, it's probably just one of those really simple things I'll have to look at more closely.
