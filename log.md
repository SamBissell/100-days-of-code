# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 6/28/21 


**Today's Progress**: Started by doings some exercises with parallax scrolling and lazy loading, that I haven't gotten the chance to actually make make from scratch.

**Thoughts:** The lazy loading wasn't working, it's probably just one of those really simple things I'll have to look at more closely.

### Day 1: 6/29/21 

**Today's Progress**: wrote a simple thing where arrow keys change the x and y position of an element.

**Thoughts:** I always feel like I should work on something like learning React or something practical, but I sometimes I drift towards doing something like this. I'd like to make a simple game some day, and honestly it doesn't seem that hard. Just add pretty sprites, animation, collision detection and a scoring system.

### Day 2: 6/30/21

**Today's Progress** DId Angela Yu's Node.js and Express.js with Node.js modules.

**Thoughts:** Feels great to be digging down beyond the front end. So much of what we do online is driven by the data and content stored somewhere, for me it's not enough to just know how to display it, I want to find, manage and edit it.

### Day 3: 7/1/21

**Today's Progress** BMI calculator and API material from Angela Yu's full-stack course.

**Thoughts:** Feels good being able to get and post on a server. Feeling unshackled from the front end.
