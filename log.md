# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 6/28/21 


**Today's Progress**: Started by doings some exercises with parallax scrolling and lazy loading, that I haven't gotten the chance to actually make make from scratch.

**Thoughts:** The lazy loading wasn't working, it's probably just one of those really simple things I'll have to look at more closely.

### Day 1: 6/29/21 

**Today's Progress**: wrote a simple thing where arrow keys change the x and y position of an element.

**Thoughts:** I always feel like I should work on something like learning React or something practical, but I sometimes I drift towards doing something like this. I'd like to make a simple game some day, and honestly it doesn't seem that hard. Just add pretty sprites, animation, collision detection and a scoring system.

### Day 2: 6/30/21

**Today's Progress** DId Angela Yu's Node.js and Express.js with Node.js modules.

**Thoughts:** Feels great to be digging down beyond the front end. So much of what we do online is driven by the data and content stored somewhere, for me it's not enough to just know how to display it, I want to find, manage and edit it.

### Day 3: 7/1/21

**Today's Progress** BMI calculator and API material from Angela Yu's full-stack course.

**Thoughts:** Feels good being able to get and post on a server. Feeling unshackled from the front end.

### Day 4: 7/2/21

**Today's Progress** Rendered OpenWeatherMaps data using express.

**Thoughts:** I've done somehting much like this all in the front end, but it's nice to do this in express, it's much cleaner having all the nuts and bolts squirreled away behind the currtain of the server.

### Day 5: 7/3/21

**Today's Progress** More express, post information from forms.

**Thoughts:** definitely have to go over get and post more, still not second nature.

### Day 6: 7/4/21

**Today's Progress** Deployed server to heroku, app is a newsletter signup using mailchimp api.

**Thoughts:** couldn't quite figure out how to get success and failure pages to load after form submission. 
Tomorrow I'm going to have to go over the content from the last few days to make sure it's solidified, it's still all learning by wrote.

### Day 6: 7/5/21

**Today's Progress** Reviewed express, moved on to EJS section in Angela Yu's Fullstack course

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm at a point where I'm picking stuff up really quickly. Also feel like I'm really confortable with the command line, which I wasn't only 3 months ago.

### Day 7: 7/6/21

**Today's Progress** More beginner EJS stuff
**Thoughts:** feeling good

### Day 8: 7/7/21

**Today's Progress** todo app using express and ejs, started learning about databases.

**Thoughts:** need to do a full project using ejs, express, but want to wait until I have databases so i can fully integrate that too.

### Day 9: 7/8/21

**Today's Progress** Basics of SQL and MOngo DB

**Thoughts:** Seems simple enough, wonder if managing lots of data without a GUI will be challenging.


### Day 10: 7/9/21

**Today's Progress** finshed CRUD in mongodb, started exploring mongoose

**Thoughts:** none really, just want to get this into the brain so that I can use it.


### Day 11: 7/10/21

**Today's Progress** mongoose
**Thoughts:** mongoose makes mongo much easier. Finding the steady rhythm of 100 days of code challenge to be very productive.
