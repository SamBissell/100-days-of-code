# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 6/28/21 


**Today's Progress**: Started by doings some exercises with parallax scrolling and lazy loading, that I haven't gotten the chance to actually make make from scratch.

**Thoughts:** The lazy loading wasn't working, it's probably just one of those really simple things I'll have to look at more closely.

### Day 1: 6/29/21 

**Today's Progress**: wrote a simple thing where arrow keys change the x and y position of an element.

**Thoughts:** I always feel like I should work on something like learning React or something practical, but I sometimes I drift towards doing something like this. I'd like to make a simple game some day, and honestly it doesn't seem that hard. Just add pretty sprites, animation, collision detection and a scoring system.
