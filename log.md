# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 6/28/21 


**Today's Progress**: Started by doings some exercises with parallax scrolling and lazy loading, that I haven't gotten the chance to actually make make from scratch.

**Thoughts:** The lazy loading wasn't working, it's probably just one of those really simple things I'll have to look at more closely.

### Day 1: 6/29/21 

**Today's Progress**: wrote a simple thing where arrow keys change the x and y position of an element.

**Thoughts:** I always feel like I should work on something like learning React or something practical, but I sometimes I drift towards doing something like this. I'd like to make a simple game some day, and honestly it doesn't seem that hard. Just add pretty sprites, animation, collision detection and a scoring system.

### Day 2: 6/30/21

**Today's Progress** DId Angela Yu's Node.js and Express.js with Node.js modules.

**Thoughts:** Feels great to be digging down beyond the front end. So much of what we do online is driven by the data and content stored somewhere, for me it's not enough to just know how to display it, I want to find, manage and edit it.

### Day 3: 7/1/21

**Today's Progress** BMI calculator and API material from Angela Yu's full-stack course.

**Thoughts:** Feels good being able to get and post on a server. Feeling unshackled from the front end.

### Day 4: 7/2/21

**Today's Progress** Rendered OpenWeatherMaps data using express.

**Thoughts:** I've done somehting much like this all in the front end, but it's nice to do this in express, it's much cleaner having all the nuts and bolts squirreled away behind the currtain of the server.

### Day 5: 7/3/21

**Today's Progress** More express, post information from forms.

**Thoughts:** definitely have to go over get and post more, still not second nature.

### Day 6: 7/4/21

**Today's Progress** Deployed server to heroku, app is a newsletter signup using mailchimp api.

**Thoughts:** couldn't quite figure out how to get success and failure pages to load after form submission. 
Tomorrow I'm going to have to go over the content from the last few days to make sure it's solidified, it's still all learning by wrote.

### Day 7: 7/5/21

**Today's Progress** Reviewed express, moved on to EJS section in Angela Yu's Fullstack course

### Day 9: 7/7/21

### Day 10: 7/8/21

### Day 11: 7/9/21

**Today's Progress** finshed CRUD in mongodb, started exploring mongoose

**Thoughts:** none really, just want to get this into the brain so that I can use it.


### Day 12: 7/10/21

**Today's Progress** mongoose
**Thoughts:** mongoose makes mongo much easier. Finding the steady rhythm of 100 days of code challenge to be very productive.

**Today's Progress** using mongo in the previous todolist app
**Thoughts:** low energy today


### Day 14: 7/12/21

### Day 15: 7/13/21

**Today's Progress** More todo lsit work
**Thoughts:** frustration with express, kind of not following 100%. Have to go back and try it out again on something else small.

**Thoughts:** this is some real life probalem solving, will have to do more research tomorrow.

### Day 17: 7/15/21

**Today's Progress** Upgraded IOS and Mongo in hopes it would fix the SSL error when onnecting to Atlas, didn't work. Not a lot online to help with the issue, loosk like I need to upgrade iOS again? started Express/ejs project from scratch, rough going, important to reinforce the basics until they're habit.
**Thoughts:** got frustrated early, stepped away and switched to express.

### Day 18: 7/16/21

**Thoughts:** trying to get these new patterns down and how vanilla js fits into them.

**Thoughts:** 


### Day 20: 7/19/21

**Thoughts:** none

### Day 24: 7/23/21

**Today's Progress**Started Angela Yu's React tutorial, figured i'd get my front end skills kosher before i tangle with backend any more.
**Thoughts:** definitely could skip ahead but I wan't to go with her flow and see how she lays everything down.

### Day 25: 7/24/21

**Today's Progress**more JSX code from tutorials.
**Thoughts:** Interesting how things make more sense when you start at the beginning.


### Day 26: 7/25/21

**Thoughts:** things didnt come 100% smoothly, but pretty intuitive all said and done. 


### Day 27: 7/26/21

**Today's Progress**React components.
**Thoughts:** React has lots of dependencies and can have lots of imported components. It's definitely way more orderly than having one huge file.

### Day 28: 7/27/21

**Today's Progress**Made a page with react components
**Thoughts:** This definitely seems to be sticking now, idk why you wouldn't make a website this way.

**Thoughts:** passing props between components was difficult.


### Day 32: 7/31/21

**Today's Progress** useHook State
**Thoughts:** It makes sense,but didn't feel the most straightforward at first. Philosophically it's like an abstraction for the purpose of limiting runaway abstraction.

**Thoughts:** tired, but it makes sense.


### Day 34: 8/2/21

**Today's Progress** Going back and making a eract app from scratch.

https://codesandbox.io/s/agitated-hertz-ljy57?file=/src/components/AdvElement.jsx:625-632

### Day 38: 8/6/21

### Day 39: 8/7/21

**Today's Progress** more trying to map nested objects to options, couldnt get it.

https://codesandbox.io/s/agitated-hertz-ljy57?file=/src/components/AdvElement.jsx:625-632

### Day 40: 8/8/21

**Today's Progress** same project, having trouble with setState and the array I'm storing state in.
**Thoughts:** Gonna keep pushing and finish the project, even if it doesnt have all the features id originally hoped for.
https://codesandbox.io/s/agitated-hertz-ljy57?file=/src/components/AdvElement.jsx:625-632


### Day 41: 8/9/21

**Today's Progress** Adjusted the styling on project. Have to add a state for expanding elements.

https://codesandbox.io/s/agitated-hertz-ljy57?file=/src/components/AdvElement.jsx:625-632

### Days 42 & 43: 8/10-11/21

**Today's Progress** Full stack app from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrHkjlWVhM. Didn't get edit functionality for some reason.
**Thoughts:** ugh, gotta struggle to find out where I went wrong. I'd like to use this as a template for a new version the random adventure generator above.

### Days 44: 8/12/21

**Today's Progress** Getting comfortable with react, analyzing the structure of 42/43 project
**Thoughts:** starting to gel i guess...

**Today's Progress** pseudo code for a full stack version of the instant adventure app
**Thoughts:** gotta get started somehow, and I want to know what im doing beofre i dive in and waste a bunch of time screwing things up.


### Days 46: 8/14/21

**Today's Progress** starting full stack version of adventure app. server in express from scratch, made a db in mongo.

**Thoughts:** good

### Days 48: 8/16/21

**Today's Progress** mapped data from mongo to form, need to reevaluate data structure of db to have all the data i need. 
**Thoughts:** good


### Days 49: 8/17/21

**Today's Progress** revised data structure of db to include an array of strings, struggled getting that right. Then struggled getting the array to be defined in express. Think I found a stack overflow that will help. 
structure of my record:
{ "category": "Environments", "options": ["Forest", "Mountain"] }

**Thoughts:** good, was frustrated, but not in a bad way, really got into getting after the problem.

### Days 50: 8/19/21

https://github.com/SamBissell/Secrets

### Days 53: 8/25/21

**Thoughts:** ...
https://github.com/SamBissell/Secrets

### Days 54: 8/26/21

**Today's Progress** decided i have to do portfolio projects, making netflix clone
**Thoughts:** not bad, basically learning react state and effect with this. will apply to other stuff later.

### Days 55: 8/27/21

**Today's Progress** made header for netflix clone
**Thoughts:** Want to figure out how to make the data query for header background conditional because some titles dont have that file. Only choose it if it does have that file. Maybe the step after that is to incorporate the user login?

### Days 56: 8/28/21

**Today's Progress** navbar
**Thoughts:** need to get better at state and effect syntax. For some reason the header bg image isnt showing, but a working src url is present in the markup.
